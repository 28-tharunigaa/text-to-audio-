# Text-to-Audio Generation AI
## Overview
This project implements a **Text-to-Audio Generation AI** that converts textual descriptions into realistic or synthetic speech/audio using deep learning models such as **Tacotron, WaveNet, or VITS**. The goal is to provide a simple interface for users to generate high-quality audio from text prompts efficiently.

## Features
- Convert text into natural-sounding speech or synthesized audio
- Support for multiple AI models (Tacotron, WaveNet, VITS, etc.)
- Customizable parameters for voice, pitch, and speed
- API and CLI support for integration with other applications
- GPU acceleration for fast processing

## Usage

### CLI Usage
Generate audio from a text prompt:
```bash
python generate.py --text "Hello, welcome to the future of AI-generated speech!"
```

### API Usage
You can also use the API to generate audio:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/generate", json={"text": "This is an AI-generated voice sample."})
audio_data = response.content

with open("output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(audio_data)
```
